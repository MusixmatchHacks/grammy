        Since 1959 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has presented a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Every year 4-5 songs are nominated and the best amongst them is given this award. We wanted to study the trends in the lyrics and music of
        these songs. As a fun exercise, we used this understanding of the trends to build a computational model which predicts the winner of this year's award. </p>

All the other songs are either in English or instrumental.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Instrumentals</h2>
      <p><a href='https://www.musixmatch.com/'>Musixmatch</a> automatically analyses whether a song is instrumental or not. Only 6 instrumental songs have been nominated for Song of the year and of them only one, Theme of Exodus by Ernest Gold (1961), has won the award.</p>

The wordiest nominee is <a class='mxm-link' href='https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Meat-Loaf/I-d-Do-Anything-for-Love-but-I-Won-t-Do-That'>I'd Do Anything by Meatloaf</a> but if we count unique words <a class='mxm-link' href='https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Eminem/Lose-Yourself'>Lose Yourself by Eminem</a>  comes out on the top.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Deep learning lyrics model</h2>
      <p>We trained a deep learning model (Doc2Vec by Google) using 150k lyrics. This model automatically infers the semantics in pieces of text and places the text in an n-dimensional space (n = 100 in our case), such that texts which are similar are located closer (a very simplified/naive explanation of the complex mathematics going on in the background).
        We used this model to calculate 100 more lyrics metrics (apart from the ones above) for training the award prediction model. It is difficult explain which characteristic of the text corresponds to each of these metrics but a more detailed explanation can be found <a href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053v2.pdf'>here</a>. </p>

      <h1 class='heading'>
        <span>Trends in music</span>
      </h1>
      <p>Echonest, a music intelligence platform, provides a bunch of interesting metrics calculated from the audio of a song. We scanned the 295 songs studied here in the Echonest database and here are some of the interesting musical trends.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Duration in seconds</h2>
      <p> <a class='mxm-link' href='https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/U-S-A-for-Africa/We-Are-the-World'>We Are the World by USA for Africa</a> is the longest song (427 seconds) to win the award. <a class='mxm-link' href='https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Meat-Loaf/I-d-Do-Anything-for-Love-but-I-Won-t-Do-That'>I'd Do Anything by Meatloaf</a> is the longest song (721 seconds) to be nominated, it is also the song with the highest word count.</p>

      <div id='' class='figure-title text-uppercase'>
        <p>Duration in seconds</p>
      </div>
      <p>We see a steady rise in the duration till the mid 90s and then a decline. This could perhaps be due to the increase in Hiphop/Dance songs (shorter than Rock/other genres) getting nominated. If we overlay the duration trend with the total word count trend this becomes even clearer with the.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Key</h2>
      <blockquote>In music theory, the key of a piece is the tonic note and chord that provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest. Other notes and chords in the piece create varying degrees of tension, resolved when the tonic note or chord returns - <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)'>Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
      <p>Majority of popular music has a well defined key and all the songs studied here as well.</p>

      <div id='' class='figure-title text-uppercase'>
        <p>Winners</p>

      <p>A major is the key most used by the winners followed by D major and C major.</p>

      <p>C major is used most by the nominees followed by G major and A major.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Loudness</h2>
      <blockquote>Echonest averages loudness across the whole song and returns a negative number with 0 being the loudest level possible.</blockquote>
      <p>The loudest song to win this award is <a class='mxm-link' href='https://open.spotify.com/track/4osg3vT6sXv6wNxm9Z6ucQ'>Rehab by Amy Winehouse</a> while the quietest one is <a class='mxm-link' href='https://open.spotify.com/track/4hObp5bmIJ3PP3cKA9K9GY'>Don't Worry Be Happy by Bobby McFerrin</a>. The quietest song overall is <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/4edgZcFVRnebJ1F46TDnqr'>Feel Like Makin' Love by Roberta Flack</a> while the loudest one overall is also Rehab.</p>
      <img id='' class = '' src='images/chart7.png'>
      <div id='' class='figure-title text-uppercase'>
        <p>Loudness</p>
      </div>
      <p>Considering the nominees and winners a steady increase in loudness of 0.17 unit/year is observed. This increase is termed by experts as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war'>loudness wars</a>. For the curious readers, there is a very detailed <a href='http://dr.loudness-war.info/'>website</a> dedicated to this.</p>

      <h2 class='text-left sub-heading'>Danceability</h2>
      <blockquote>Describes how suitable a track is for dancing using a number of musical elements (the more suitable for dancing, the closer to 1.0 the value). The combination of musical elements that best characterize danceability include tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity - <a href='http://developer.echonest.com/acoustic-attributes.html'>Echonest</a></blockquote>
      <p>It is an interesting metric even though not decisive in choosing the winner (according to our model as discussed later). The danceability of Song of the year nominees and winners has been rising (.0007 unit/year).</p>

      <h1 class='heading'>
        <span>Predicting a winner</span>
      </h1>
      <p>We analysed many audio and lyrics metrics (including the ones discussed above) for all the nominees and winners. Then we trained a machine learning model (a random forest classifier<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest'><sup>1</sup></a>) training with the winners and nominees till 2015. We used this model to make a prediction using the audio and lyrics metrics for the nominees of 2016.</p>
      <p>Apart from making a prediction the model can also tell us which metrics were decisive in understanding whether a song is a nominee or a winner. Considering all important metrics (71 lyrics metrics and 17 audio metrics), lyrics contributed 4 times as much as music in deciding a winner for Song of the year. This comparison is not fair because there are more lyrics metrics than audio.</p>

      <p>Despite being mostly instrumental Electronic artists seem to pack a lot of swear words in their music. Diplo leads the rankings here followed by DeadMau5 and Hardwell. (There was an error earlier where Ryuichi Sakamoto  was #2 in this list but it has been fixed now.)</p>

        <span>Rock</span>

      <p>There is a marked decrease in the profanity frequency of the rest of the genres as compared to Hip-Hop, Heavy Metal and Electronic. Amongst the rock artists, Green Day and Red Hot Chili Peppers use profanity most frequently. The most used swear words are different for both.</p>

      <p>1 in every 47 words in Hiphop lyrics is a swear word. This also means <b>every Hiphop song has 10 profanities on average</b>.</p>
      <p>The top 3 swear words used are nigga, shit and niggas. But the 'n word' is generally not used in an offensive context in Hiphop. On removing it alongwith its conjugations from the analysis of Hiphop lyrics, 1 in every 74 words is a swear word in
        Hiphop lyrics. This still means 6 profanities in every song. Even with this reduction hip hop still remains the most profane genre overall.</p>

        <span>Conclusion</span>

      <p>Combining all the nominees and winners in this category since 1959 gives us a total of 295 songs (59 winners and 231 nominees - excluding the nominees of 2016). This is not enough data to build an accurate model and also there are many factors which can't be modeled. Thus, these predictions should be taken with a very big pinch of salt.</p>
      <p>The trends studied give interesting insights and we would explore these in more detail in the future.</p>
